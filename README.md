# dank bot` 
A meme generator

## Mini Docs
`autoLeaveVoice` - When set to `true`, the bot will leave after playing a sound. The sound of a bot joining/leaving a voice channel can be annoying, so by setting this to false, the bot will stay in the voice channel until told to leave by the `!bot exit` command.

`autoLoadSounds` - When set to `true`, the bot will attempt to load in every file placed in the `sounds` directory. To generate the sound's command, `soundCommandTrigger` is prepended, the audio extension is stripped off, and hyphens are converted to spaces.

*For example, `nasa-smallstep.mp3` would be activated by `!nasa smallstep`.*

`commands.set(<regexp>, array[type, reply])` - `regexp` is what your bot will match messages against, regular expressions are used here mainly to make things case-insensitive. `type` can currently be `function`, `sound`, or `text`, but can be extended further if your bot requires additional functionality.
